# HomeAwaySearch
App to demonstrate JSON parsing utilizing the HomeAway Beta APIs. 

The app currently uses AppAuth for 3-legged OAuth authentication with the HomeAway servers.

# Development Notice
I'm still developing the app (Put on back burner due to work hours), it's recommended to test with API levels 17, currently does not support custom tabs for OAuth authentication in higher Android versions. This is something I will be working towards in the future.

# Will this be a full blown HomeAway App
No. The idea behind the app is to demo my knowledge of working with RESTful JSON APIs that require user authentication.
